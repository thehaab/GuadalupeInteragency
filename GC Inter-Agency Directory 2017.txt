Special Note: If the bad teeth need to be removed the best price around is at the University of
Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Need a referral from their local Dentist, have him
email the x-rays of the teeth and his diagnosis as to what needs to be done. The UTHSC also
does dentures, root canals and braces at a much discounted rate. It is a slow process but worth
the wait due to the cost savings, however if your client is in pain, make them aware of that and it
helps to get you in sooner. They have an emergency clinic that will take you the day after you
call for teeth with pain. Other issues take longer to get lined up for.

CRCG are local interagency groups comprised of public and private agencies that help develop
service plans for individuals and families whose needs can be met only through interagency
coordination and cooperation. The Guadalupe County CRCG serves children, families, and
adults.

Building trusting relationships and working in partnership, CRCGs are doing what no one
agency could do alone. By working together, they make it more likely for individuals and
families to receive the assistance they need before the situation becomes unsolvable. In many
communities, CRCGs identify service gaps in their area and help plan for appropriate resources
to meet their client’s needs. As a result, more people get the service support they need.

Application Process:

The process starts by requesting staffing. You can speak with your agency’s CRCG
representative or you can contact the CRCG chairperson directly to request a staffing. There is a
packet of information to complete that includes release forms and some basic background
information. Once a staffing is scheduled, you will need to contact the individual/family to be
staffed and any other agencies that are involved to ensure they are invited to attend the staffing.
During the staffing, CRCG members combine their knowledge and resources to develop a
specific plan to help address the identified service needs. There are follow-up staffing at one
month, 3 months, and 6 months to ensure that the needs have been addressed.

All areas of the nation are prone to some type of natural disaster. Guadalupe County, like all
counties in this region, has a history of experiencing drought, tornados, thunderstorms, and
hurricanes. In addition, some areas are particularly susceptible to flash flooding. While our
biggest potential threat is a natural disaster, as the county continues to grow so does the
possibility of a manmade hazardous event. While the timing and intensity of these events can
never be exactly predicted there are many steps we can take to dramatically lessen the impact.

Disaster Management is a team effort. The Office of Emergency Management works closely
with the Guadalupe County Commissioners Court, Sheriff's Office, area Fire Departments,
Hospitals, Schools, and other city and regional entities to constantly refine and practice the
elements of the county disaster plan. The goal at the Office of Emergency Management is to be
proactive in mitigation and preparation so the county and its citizens are prepared before the next
event occurs. Likewise, we are here to assist local state and federal agencies with response and
recovery during and after the event.

Services provided:

Guadalupe Valley Christian Counseling Center (GVCCC) is a non-profit Christian agency
supported by area churches. While our staff members are committed Christians with their own
faith statements and understandings, their purpose is not to preach to clients. They are clinically
trained and experienced professionals who utilize the tools of the psychotherapeutic fields to
help clients achieve optimal mental, emotional and spiritual health. Tools of the faith such as
confession and forgiveness, prayer, and Biblical meditation can be used when the client feels
comfortable with them and can be benefited therapeutically. Individual Therapy, Couple and
Family Therapy, Specialized Services (Psychological testing, Career planning, career counseling
and life coaching), and Family Life Education Programs are available.

Eligibility: GVCCC provides quality care with fees on a sliding scale. The client portion of the
fee, set during the first visit, is based on family income and family size. In many instances, a
client's health insurance will pay a portion of the fee. Fees for family life education programs are
dependent on length and type of program. Please bring health insurance information and forms to
your appointment.

all allowable deduction is then used to determine eligibility. There is also a resource limit that
considers the value of vehicles, bank accounts, and cash on hand. To receive TANF a family
must be below income and resource limits set for the program as well. These income and
resource limits differ from the SNAP guidelines
